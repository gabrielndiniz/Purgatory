# \# Purgatory



A dark survival action game built in Unity for Brackeys Game Jam #15.



Humanity died when the air turned against them.  

Your mask filters ran out.  

You died too.



But something called you back.



There are no survivors.  

There is no hope.  

Only peace.

\## About the Game



Purgatory is a fast-paced survival action experience set in a world that has already fallen.  

The player returns from death and must fight through what remains in order to bring the cycle to an end.



Built during a limited-time game jam, the project focuses on:



\- Clean state-driven game flow

\- Modular trigger-based progression

\- Responsive movement and rotation system

\- Reactive UI (health bar, fade transitions, end screens)

\- Minimalist atmospheric storytelling
